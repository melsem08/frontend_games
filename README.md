## General Info

This project was created in order to improve my front-end coding skills including using React, CSS, HTML during participation in Northcoders Bootcamp.

Games World Magazine â€” a board games content rating and discussion website. You can find a list of board game reviews on the site, all of them contain useful information about different games both popular and lesser known. All reviews can be sorted using different parameters provided to the user. You can also log into an account and leave comments to any review, upvote or downvote them, change comment ratings etc.

This front-end project is built using back-end project I worked before, you can find it [here on Github](https://github.com/melsem08/backend_games)

The hosted API for this back-end is located [here](https://games-api-project.onrender.com/api)
